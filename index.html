<h1 id="what-is-crows-end">What is Crows End?</h1>

<p>Crowsend is a web based roleplaying game with an emphasis on player interaction. It will be a hybrid MUD/MUSH using the Evennia and AresMUSH engines.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-a-mud-or-a-mush">What is a MUD or a MUSH?</h1>

<p>Multi-User Dungoens (MUD) are text-based multiplayer games that evolved from the days of dial-up bulliten boards systems (BBS). Many MMORPGs have evolved from MUD roots, and Runescape in particular first began as a MUD.</p>

<p>A MUSH is a MUD that focuses more on roleplaying and player content, while MUDs tend to focus on PVE content.</p>

<h1 id="is-crowsend-a-mud-or-a-mush">Is Crowsend a MUD or a MUSH?</h1>

<p>It is going to be a bit of both. A web based MUSH for players to play-by-post, with a MUD for real time interaction and PVE. Both systems will have hooks into discord which will provide players an OOC area to collaborate story ideas and form groups.</p>

<p>The web based MUSH will be the initial focus of Crows End.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-setting-of-crows-end">What is the setting of Crows End?</h1>

<p>Set 20 years into the future, something strange is happening in the Pacific Northwest town of Crows End. No one knows whether its due to an experiment by the ever watchful by secretive federal government, toxic chemicals leaking into the drinking water, the machinations of eldrich cultists, or the result of something awakening in the neighboring Olympic forest. However, some people are finding that they have special powers and are more surprised to discover that they’re not alone. But while they explore what these new powers are and what it means to have them, they are not the only thing that has changed in the city. Something evil is growing in the dark alleys and shadows. It will be up to these newly gifted people to contain it, if they’re able to maintain their humanity.</p>
